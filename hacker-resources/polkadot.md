## Developer resources

**ü¶Ä Appchain development** 

_Get started with contract development:_

- [ink!](https://use.ink/): a programming language for Substrate native smart contracts.
- [Contracts UI](https://ui.use.ink/?rpc=wss://rpc2.paseo.popnetwork.xyz): a simple UI for deploying contracts to various appchains that contain the contracts pallet. 
- [Create dApp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-polkadot-dapp): bootstamp you project in just one command: `npx create-polkadot-dapp@latest`
- [[Preview "Work in Progress" Contracts UI](https://contracts.polkadot.io/): Preview creating Ethereum-compatible dApps using Solidity and ethers.js to create smart contracts using a REMIX web frontend (customized for Polkadot). Behind to scenes it recompiles using YUL to RISC-V, runs using PolkaVM instead of EVM, and deploys to AssetHub system parachain on Westend Testnet (Polkadot test environment).

_Or dive into building with the Polkadot SDK:_

Planning on hacking on your own appchain idea using the [Polkadot SDK: The Parity Polkadot Blockchain SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)? Start by [setting up your development environment](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/) for Rust and Substrate. Then, dive into [this hands-on guide](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/guides/your_first_pallet/index.html) to learn about building your first FRAME pallet. üöÄ Also, there's the [Polkadot Cloud: Comprehensive guides and information for using and contributing to Polkadot Cloud](https://docs.polkadot.cloud/), where whether you're a developer, a staker, or a contributor, you'll find everything you need to get started using and developing the Polkadot Cloud platform.

Here are some appchain templates for you to start hacking on an appchain idea:

- [Generic Runtime Template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/tree/main/generic-template): This template by OpenZeppelin has all the basic features you expect to find on a typical L1 blockchain or parachain. Basic, yet preserving the most important pallets that are used in the Polkadot ecosystem today and a safe runtime base configuration. Head to [their docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/substrate-runtimes/) for a quickstart guide!
- [EVM Parachain Template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/tree/main/evm-template): a parachain template by OpenZeppelin for launching EVM-compatible parachains.
- [Minimal, Solochain and Parachain Templates](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates): Default templates available on Polkadot SDK

Also, check out [Tanssi network](https://www.tanssi.network/) and [onpop.io](https://onpop.io/) which provide intuitive tooling that enables deployment of appchains.

## üõú Testnets 

[Westend](https://polkadot.com/blog/westend-introducing-a-new-testnet-for-polkadot-and-kusama) is a testing environment for Polkadot infrastructure partners to test their Polkadot and Kusama deployment and processes

[Paseo](https://github.com/paseo-network) is a Polkadot-like test network maintained by the Polkadot community that contains a number of ecosystem parachains connected to it as well as [core system chains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-system-chains).

You might want to test out interacting with one of the system chains, like the AssetHub, BridgeHub, Coretime or People chains. Or deploy ink! contracts to the dedicated Contracts chain.

- Use the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/) to receive WND or PAS or any token of the test chains you like to experiment with.
- Head to the [Paseo developer console](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpaseo.rpc.amforc.com#/explorer) to explore the chains connected to it.
