The Consensus hackathon for Polkadot (14-16.05.2025) consisted of three tracks: Build, Launch and Multi-chain (bonus track).
The Build track was for any project submitting who started an idea from scratch during the hackathon.
The Launch track was open to teams who are continuing to work on an idea they already have code for and the Multi-chain bonus track was for any team submitting to other sponsor tracks who made their submission integrate Polkadot in some way.

The winners were:

**Build Track**

- Sutampu ($5,000.00)
- DOT Striker ($3,000.00)
- Merge Fund ($1,500.00)

**Launch Track**
- Proctodot ($5,000.00)
- Smart Trust ($3,000.00)
- Rate Zilla ($1,500.00)

**Multi-chain**
- Eunoia ($1,000.00)

| OrbitPass    | OrbitPass is our answer to one of Web3â€™s biggest problems: the user experience. Right now, trying to use different dapps feels clunky and fragmented. You have to set up new wallets, sign transactions constantly, and repeat the same onboarding steps over and over again. We wanted to fix that. OrbitPass lets you use just one secure passkey â€” like Face ID or a fingerprint â€” to log into any Stellar-based dapp that supports it. No more wallet extensions, no more seed phrases, and no more starting from scratch every time you try something new. Itâ€™s like a Web3 version of "Login with Google", but built with open tools on Stellar. | Frontend Framework: React with Hooks & Context API. Routing & UI: React Router + Material UI (MUI). Networking: Axios for REST calls to our Django API.
