## Build novel user interfaces for interacting with Polkadot ($3k)

Although Polkadot is a network of interoperable layer-1 chains, users really shouldn’t even know what chain they're using when interacting with Polkadot. What should matter is what they intend to achieve. This bounty seeks dApp submissions that push this narrative.

For this bounty, you'll be creating new ways to interact with Polkadot's existing services, setting the stage for the next wave of UIs for the rest of the ecosystem.

This bounty is looking for submissions that create a UI that improve how users can interact with the core Polkadot system (i.e. the relay chain and its system chains). Successful submissions will serve an actual need in the ecosystem or provide a fun, different way to do things on Polkadot that doesn't already exist.

## Appchain development with the Polkadot SDK ($4k)

The Polkadot SDK is a powerful open source SDK that allows teams to build custom blockchains. For this bounty, we invite #BUIDLers to design and submit an appchain POC implementation, which could be either an extension of an existing chain or a new appchain idea for Polkadot. Successful submissions are ones that:

- Provide a unique service to the Polkadot network and its existing appchains
- Identify and meet a need for Polkadot's end-users and ecosystem agents

## Create tools to help developers build on Polkadot ($2k)

When it comes to tooling and developer experience in the Polkadot ecosystem, there are a number of available solutions to choose from, each of which cater to distinct groups of developers. A successful submission to this bounty has identified a tool that might be missing for Polkadot developers and creates or reimagines something completely new. Some ideas:

- a tool to turn an ink! dapp into an appchain
- a tool to tinker with different appchain configurations
- a Scaffold-ETH like experience for building on Polkadot
